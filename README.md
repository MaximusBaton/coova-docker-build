The CoovaChilli project can be located here:
[https://coova.github.io/](https://coova.github.io/)

The only requirement for this project to run is a recent version of [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To get started after cloning the git repository, simply run:

  `./make.sh`

Upon successful completion this build will output a coova-chilli*.deb package to the target/ directory.
